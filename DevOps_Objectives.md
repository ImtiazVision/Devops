### The goad of DevOps 

#### The shortcomings of traditional approach 

The DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration between development and operations. The conventional paradigm against which DevOps culture grew out ofÂ is necessary to grasp first.

The classic paradigm separates development and operations, with competing agendas. The development team's objective is to get features into customers' hands as soon as they can. But the operations team's mission is to ensure system stability and minimize downtime. Changes are one of the worst things for stability, therefore these two aims wind up being mutually exclusive.

Changing the system increases the danger of instability.
So operations tries to keep things stable while development tries to make changes as quickly as feasible. They must deploy updates in order to give functionality to users. Those alterations endanger the stability of the whole system.

So these two objectives are mutually exclusive. Although both parties wish to work together, their objectives can conflict. Developers are often judged on their delivery speed. Downtime is measured by operations teams. As a result, they have a strong desire to fight each other.

Speed and stability are important goals, but because the development and operations teams are in competition, neither can achieve them well. The operations team is attempting to slow down the development team in order to preserve stability. So this opposition undermines both aims.


#### DevOps saves the day

In a DevOps culture, development and operations teams work together to achieve common objectives. And they're both measured by the same standards. Speed and stability are critical. DevOps culture has recognized that when development and operations work together, they can uncover solutions and create tools that help a company achieve both speed and stability while allowing development, frequent and rapid deployment, and robust system changes while maintaining customer stability. So both aims are achieved far more effectively than when two different factions attack one other.

#### With DevOps:
   - Both development and operations are on the same team.
   - The aims of development and operations are the same.

#### DevOps Goals 

DevOps aims for stability and speed. A DevOps organization's purpose is to reduce **time-to-market(TTM)**. **Time-to-market(TTM)** is the time it takes to bring a product from a development team to a client. Time-to-market is the time it takes from coding completion to functioning in production. And the quicker the organization can advertise, the better.

Another purpose is to reduce manufacturing failures. This brings us back to the topic of stability. The greater the number of manufacturing failures, the greater the insecurity. So, if we want production to be stable, we must ensure that there are a few production failures, and we must create solutions that will enable us to deploy rapidly so that we can come to market quickly while also limiting the amount of failures produced by those modifications.

Another aim related to stability is quick recovery from failures. Failures are unavoidable in the real world. Mistakes will be made, and everything will fall apart. Any organization that does not acknowledge this is delusionary, since it will always happen. The greatest thing we can do is guarantee that when such difficulties do arise, we can recover swiftly and completely. The earlier we recover from challenges, the less of an influence they will have. In the best-case scenario, we can recover from a breakdown before consumers notice. And DevOps engineers will strive to make it happen. Development and operations work collaboratively in DevOps. In a DevOps culture, developers value stability as much as speed, and Ops values speed as much as stability. In a DevOps culture, the lines between developers and operations engineers might blur. That is, developers may take on more and more operations engineering tasks, while operations engineers can take on more and more development responsibilities.
