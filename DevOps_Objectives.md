### The goad of DevOps 

#### The shortcomings of traditional approach 

The DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration between development and operations. The conventional paradigm against which DevOps culture grew out ofÂ is necessary to grasp first.

The classic paradigm separates development and operations, with competing agendas. The development team's objective is to get features into customers' hands as soon as they can. But the operations team's mission is to ensure system stability and minimize downtime. Changes are one of the worst things for stability, therefore these two aims wind up being mutually exclusive.

Changing the system increases the danger of instability.
So operations tries to keep things stable while development tries to make changes as quickly as feasible. They must deploy updates in order to give functionality to users. Those alterations endanger the stability of the whole system.

So these two objectives are mutually exclusive. Although both parties wish to work together, their objectives can conflict. Developers are often judged on their delivery speed. Downtime is measured by operations teams. As a result, they have a strong desire to fight each other.

Speed and stability are important goals, but because the development and operations teams are in competition, neither can achieve them well. The operations team is attempting to slow down the development team in order to preserve stability. So this opposition undermines both aims.
