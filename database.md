Relational Database Service (RDS): Provides cost-effective and scalability in addition to handling time-consuming database management responsibilities, allowing us to concentrate on our applications and business.

**Amazon RDS** : connects us to a number of well-known database engines, including Amazon Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. This implies that we may utilize the same code, apps, and tools that we use with our old databases with RDS.

RDS updates the database software and backs up our database automatically, saving backups for a user-defined retention period and allowing point-in-time recovery.
