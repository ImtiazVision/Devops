### AWS Lambda 

**Lambda** : This is a service that allows us to upload a function to AWS and pay for each time the code is performed or called.

We are not responsible for operating the OS or the VM. Lambda takes care of everything for us. Consider a tax calculator, for instance. We would write the code in the usual way. Acquire a virtual machine on which to deploy your code. After that, we must maintain and monitor our deployment. However, with Lambda, we don't have to pay for or maintain the virtual machine; Amazon takes care of it for us.
