### Timeline of DevOps

2007: Agile software development was gaining popularity, but it was also beset by a growing schism between development and operations.
Patrick Debois, an engineer with experience in both development and operations, was testing on a project in 2007 when he became frustrated by the vast difference between the two.
Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer met in 2008 at the Agile2008 Conference in Toronto, Canada. They began to initiate conversations and seek out others who were interested in bridging the gap between development and operations.
On June 23, 2009, John Allspaw and Paul Hammond presented "10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr" at Velocity Conference. Patrick was watching via livestream. People began talking about it on Twitter.
Patrick hosted the first DevOpsDays in Ghent, Belgium, on October 30-31, 2009; a conference for both developers and operations engineers. The discussion continued on Twitter using the hashtag #devops.
DevOps evolved into an organic, grassroots movement all over the world, spawning a plethora of tools to support the practices valued by DevOps.
